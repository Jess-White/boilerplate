Users can log in and access a shared dashboard, where they can see grant applications in process as well as stored materials. Users access stored content and grant drafts through an organization dashboard, which also includes information about recent drafts, upcoming grant deadlines, and user activity. We are currently building out collaborative content creation and review features to ensure that all staff can participate in grant writing and research.",

Users can find and add stored content using the boilerplate menu, revise stored content they add to a section, and add new content using the text editor interface. Users can also add any grant section to the boilerplate library. Boilerplateâ€™s grant creation feature is also designed to connect grant applications with funding organizations, so that users can more easily move back and forth between their work in progress and any directives provided by the funding organization. Boilerplate provides content management for grants as well as grant materials. Users can search drafted and completed grants by title, category, and funding organization. Once grants are submitted, users can track application status and mark grants as successful so they can be targeted for review. We are currently building out a reports feature to help users draft and organize grant reports.",

Boilerplates are organized by category and searchable by title, text, and word count. Users create their own categories to reflect their organization areas of interest and then store boilerplates within each category.",
