      Cain started attending Operation Spark, a New Orleans-based coding bootcamp, while in his sophomore year of high school and quickly found out he had a knack for programming. His passion for learning and teaching new ideas and technologies led him to later become a teacher for the organization! As a teacher and as an engineer, Cain strives to bring personality, empathy, and fun to the otherwise boring or tedious parts of software development. In his spare time, Cain enjoys fashion, drawing, and learning foreign languages -- he's currently learning Mandarin!
      <br>
      <br>

      Cain loves learning, and he loves sharing his knowledge with others even more. Cain's programming journey started in high school after an accidental fated encounter with coding in an AP computer science course, which propelled him towards a career in software development. He attended Operation Spark, a coding bootcamp based in New Orleans, where he enrolled as a student before working as a teacher and core developer. He worked on the learning management platform to track and facilitate student grading and coursework using Node, Meteor.js, and GitHub's API.
      <br>
      <br>

      Cain excels at JavaScript - he even knows weird and fun quirks about the language! - and is flexible with any of its frameworks: React, Angular, or Vue. Cain is passionate about leaving detailed documentation and practicing empathy, both in conversation and in code. His personal goal is to make the web more accessible to all.
      <br>
      <br>

      In his free time, Cain enjoys reading sci-fi novels (Octavia Butler, anyone?) and learning three different languages (He's got a streak count that belongs in Duolingo's Streak Hall of Fame!).

      Jess came up with the idea for Boilerplate while she was still in bootcamp, and has spent the past two years growing her coding skills along with the app. She believes that coding is communication, and that responsive, empathetic design is critical to providing equal access.
      <br>
      <br>

      Before migrating into tech, she worked as a grant writer, English teacher, and nonfiction writer. Creating diverse content for a diverse group of clients taught her the importance of accessible digital communications tools. Boilerplate was inspired by her work as a grantwriter for small nonprofits.
      <br>
      <br>

      She is currently a Software Engineer at Home Chef and formerly worked as a Software Engineer at Tandem.
      <br>
      <br>

      When she is not coding, she reads and cooks. Currently, she’s re-reading Iain M. Banks’s Culture series. She also recently made a goat cheese cheesecake (excellent) and a blue cheese cheesecake (vile).

      With a background in physics and education, Eli is driven to understand the "why" behind a problem, and to inspire that curiosity in others.
      <br>
      <br>

      Eli stumbled upon user-centered design while creating interactive science demonstrations as a lab instructor in the MIT physics department. He became fascinated by intentionally designing learning objects and experiences, which he pursued at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC), receiving a masters in Designed Objects.
      <br>
      <br>

      After working in education spaces on user research and physical learning kits, he discovered that much of the most exciting work was in the digital space. He is currently Lead Product Designer at TutorMe.
      <br>
      <br>

      In addition to teaching physics, he has taught design thinking to undergraduates at SAIC, and developed and led summer workshops for middle school students. As an educator, his goal is to draw students as far as possible into self designing their own learning experiences.
      <br>
      <br>

      Beyond his design work, he experiments with photography and printmaking, often turning his camera to the sky to take astronomical photos.
