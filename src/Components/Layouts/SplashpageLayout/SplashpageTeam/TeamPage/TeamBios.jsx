      Mike became a software engineer because he wanted to solve complex problems, and he joined Boilerplate because he wanted to use his engineering skills to give back to the community.
      <br>
      <br>

      Mike’s prior professional experience is in events management. As an operations manager, he faced a lot of urgent challenges, and he enjoyed working with his team to find a creative solution. He believes that collaboration and smooth communication are both critical to team success, and he is excited to build these values into Boilerplate.
      <br>
      <br>

      Mike is currently a Software Engineer at Trajektory, where he has worked for the past two years.

      Cain started attending Operation Spark, a New Orleans-based coding bootcamp, while in his sophomore year of high school and quickly found out he had a knack for programming. His passion for learning and teaching new ideas and technologies led him to later become a teacher for the organization! As a teacher and as an engineer, Cain strives to bring personality, empathy, and fun to the otherwise boring or tedious parts of software development. In his spare time, Cain enjoys fashion, drawing, and learning foreign languages -- he's currently learning Mandarin!
      <br>
      <br>

      Cain loves learning, and he loves sharing his knowledge with others even more. Cain's programming journey started in high school after an accidental fated encounter with coding in an AP computer science course, which propelled him towards a career in software development. He attended Operation Spark, a coding bootcamp based in New Orleans, where he enrolled as a student before working as a teacher and core developer. He worked on the learning management platform to track and facilitate student grading and coursework using Node, Meteor.js, and GitHub's API.
      <br>
      <br>

      Cain excels at JavaScript - he even knows weird and fun quirks about the language! - and is flexible with any of its frameworks: React, Angular, or Vue. Cain is passionate about leaving detailed documentation and practicing empathy, both in conversation and in code. His personal goal is to make the web more accessible to all.
      <br>
      <br>

      In his free time, Cain enjoys reading sci-fi novels (Octavia Butler, anyone?) and learning three different languages (He's got a streak count that belongs in Duolingo's Streak Hall of Fame!).

      Jess came up with the idea for Boilerplate while she was still in bootcamp, and has spent the past two years growing her coding skills along with the app. She believes that coding is communication, and that responsive, empathetic design is critical to providing equal access.
      <br>
      <br>

      Before migrating into tech, she worked as a grant writer, English teacher, and nonfiction writer. Creating diverse content for a diverse group of clients taught her the importance of accessible digital communications tools. Boilerplate was inspired by her work as a grantwriter for small nonprofits.
      <br>
      <br>

      She is currently a Software Engineer at Home Chef and formerly worked as a Software Engineer at Tandem.
      <br>
      <br>

      When she is not coding, she reads and cooks. Currently, she’s re-reading Iain M. Banks’s Culture series. She also recently made a goat cheese cheesecake (excellent) and a blue cheese cheesecake (vile).
